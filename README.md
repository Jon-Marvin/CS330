## How do I approach designing software?
I approach designing software the same way I approach everything else in life. I try to learn as much as possible when doing just about anything, and designing software, in this case a scene, is something that you can learn by viewing. I opened the scene after each new implementation to ensure it was the correct size and in the correct place. 

## How do I approach developing programs?
Developing programs has to be done with a certain amount of finese. I try to map out everything before I begin coding so I don't run into any issues. That normally doesn't work, but at least I have an idea of how to fix it with the plan I create.

## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
My goal with computer science is to learn as much as I can. I want to be a well rounded programmer in as many languages as possible. Right now, I am strongest in Python due to my work in Data Analytics, but I would like to improve my skills in C++ and C# to open up more avenues of creation.
